# SQL Ecommerce Analysis Project

## 📌 Business Problem
An ecommerce company wants to analyze its sales performance, customer behavior, and product profitability to support data-driven business decisions.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- MySQL
- SQL (Joins, Aggregations, Group By, Date Functions)

## 📊 Analysis Performed
- Total revenue calculation
- Revenue breakdown by product category
- Identification of top customers by total spend
- Monthly revenue trend analysis
- Product-level profit analysis

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Electronics is the highest revenue-generating category, driven primarily by laptop and smartphone sales.
- A small group of customers contributes a significant portion of total revenue, highlighting the importance of high-value customers.
- Monthly revenue shows an upward trend from January to March, indicating steady growth in sales activity.
- High-selling products are not always the most profitable, emphasizing the need to balance pricing and cost strategies.

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Focus marketing and inventory efforts on high-performing electronics while optimizing costs to improve margins.
- Introduce loyalty programs for top customers to increase retention and lifetime value.
- Review pricing and sourcing strategies for low-margin products to improve overall profitability.
